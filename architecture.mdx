This document specifies a proposed standard for identity management of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in the internet. OAIP is a language-agnostic protocol for establishing cryptographic identities for AI agents, enabling authentication, authorization, and audit trails across heterogeneous systems.

The proposed standard creates a framework that allows an AI agent to obtain approval to a resource running a model context protocol (MCP) server by requesting an agent identifier token tied to an end user. 

This and following pages goes into the structure of the agent identifiers and the authorization process performed between the client and server through OAIP.
