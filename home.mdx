## What is OAIP?

OAIP(Open Agent Identity Protocol) is an open-source standard for authentication, attestation, and governance of artificial intelligence (AI) agents.

Think of it like OAuth for AI agents. There's an increasing problem of agents getting full permissions to API keys, secrets, permissions and running AS the user. This will become a larger problem when the line of action between what a human and non-human actor do becomes blurred. This has implications not just at a security level but also a legal, societal, and economic level.

OAIP is being built and proposed to the IETF to provide a universal standard for identity in the Internet of Agents (IoA) so that anyone, anywhere, can build secure agents and gain visibility with confidence.
